\title{Grouping of values into sets with smallest differences}
\usage{
groupClosest(x, maxDiff = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{numeric} of values that should be grouped.}

\item{maxDiff}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the threshold for difference between
values in \code{x} to be grouped into the same group.}
}
\value{
\code{integer} with the group assignment (values grouped together have
the same value).
}
\description{
\code{groupClosest} groups values in \code{x} for which the difference is smaller than
\code{maxDiff}. As a result, the mean value between the groups will always be
larger than \code{maxDiff}. Values which would be assigned to more than one
group, are assigned to the one with the smallest difference to the group
mean value.

In detail, from the sorted \code{x}, the function starts from the smallest value
defining the first group as the one containing all
values in \code{x} with a difference to this first value which is \verb{<= maxDiff}.
The next group is the defined based on the next larger value not being part
of the first group and includes all values with a difference \verb{<= maxDiff} to
this value. For values fulfilling this criteria but being already part of
a previous group, the differences to the mean value of the current group
and to the mean of previous groups are compared and values are assigned to
the group to which they have the smallest difference.

Example: values \verb{1.1, 1.9, 2.2} should be grouped with a \code{maxDiff = 1}. The
first group is defined to include all values for which the difference to the
first value (\code{1.1}) is smaller \code{maxDiff}. Thus, the first group is defined
to contain values \verb{1.1 and 1.9}. Then the next group is defined based on the
next larger value not part of any group, \code{2.2}. This group contains values
\code{1.9} and \code{2.2} with the value \code{1.9} being already assigned to the first
group. The difference between this value \code{1.9} and the mean of the
current group (\verb{mean(c(1.9, 2.2)}) is then compared to the difference of
\code{1.9} to the mean value of the group \code{1.9} is already part of
(which is \code{mean(c(1.1, 1.9))}). Since the difference to the second group is
smaller, \code{1.9} is removed from the first group and assigned to the second
one.
}
\note{
This grouping approach, in contrast to \code{\link[xcms:groupOverlaps]{xcms::groupOverlaps()}}, creates
smaller groups and values might not be included into the same group even
if their difference is smaller than \code{maxDiff} (see examples below).

\examples{

## The example described above
x <- c(1.1, 1.9, 2.2)
groupClosest(x)

x <- c(1.1, 1.5, 1.7, 2.3, 2.7, 4.3, 4.4, 4.9, 5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 6, 7, 9, 9.5, 15)

groupClosest(x)
## value 5.2 was initially grouped with 4.3 (because their difference is
## smaller 1, but then re-grouped together with 5.4 because the difference
## between 5.4 (the next value outside the group of 4.3) and 5.2 is smaller
## than its difference to the mean value of the group for value 4.3

## Example for a case in which values are NOT grouped into the same group
## even if the difference between them is <= maxDiff
a <- c(4.9, 5.2, 5.4)
groupClosest(a, maxDiff = 0.3)
