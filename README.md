# Computational Metabolomics Team Utilities

This package provides utilities commonly used in analyses of the Eurac IfB
Computational Metabolomics Team. Functions found to be of particular and general
usability might be later added to *core* packages, depending on their context,
such as `xcms`, `MSnbase`, `MsCoreUtils` etc.
