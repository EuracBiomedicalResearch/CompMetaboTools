# Introduction

In a typical LC-MS-based metabolomics experiment compounds eluting from the
chromatography are first ionized before being measured by mass spectrometry
(MS). During the ionization different (multiple) ions can be generated from the
same compound which all will be measured by MS. In general, the resulting data
is then pre-processed to identify chromatographic peaks in the data and to group
these across samples in the correspondence analysis. The result are distinct
LC-MS features, characterized by their specific m/z and retention time
range. Different ions generated during ionization will be detected as different
features. To reduce data set complexity (and to aid in subsequent annotation
steps) it is advisable to group features which are supposedly representing
signal from the same original ion. This document describes functionality to aid
in this feature grouping step which are provided by this package.

# LC-MS feature grouping

We demonstrate the feature grouping functionality on the simple toy data set
used also in the `r Biocpkg("xcms")` package and provided through the `faahKO`
package. This data set consists of samples from 4 mice with knock-out of the
fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and 4 wild type mice. Pre-processing of this
data set is described in detail in the *xcms* vignette of the `xcms`
package. Below we load all required packages and the result from this
pre-processing updating also the location of the respective raw data files on
the current machine.

```{r load-data}
library(xcms)
library(faahKO)
library(CompMetaboTools)

data("xdata")
## Update the path to the files for the local system
dirname(xdata) <- paste0(system.file("cdf/", package = "faahKO"),
                         rep(c("KO", "WT"), each = 4))
```

Before performing the feature grouping we inspect the result object. With
`featureDefinitions` we can extract the results from the correspondence
analysis.

```{r fdev}
featureDefinitions(xdata)
```

Each row in this data frame represents the definition of one feature, with its
average and range of m/z and retention time. Column `"peakidx"` provides the
index of each chromatographic peak which is assigned to the feature in the
`chromPeaks` matrix of the result object. The `featureValues` function allows to
extract *feature values*, i.e. a matrix with feature abundances, one row per
feature and columns representing the samples of the present data set.

Below we extract the feature values with and without *filled-in* peak
data. Without the gap-filled data only abundances from **detected**
chromatographic peaks are reported, with gap-filled data, for samples in which
no chromatographic peak was identified (e.g. because peak detection failed for
that ion in that particular sample) data was filled-in in samples in which no
peak was detected integrating all signal from the MS region defined by the m/z -
retention time range of the detected chromatographic peak in the other samples.

```{r filled-not-filled}
head(featureValues(xdata, filled = FALSE))
head(featureValues(xdata, filled = TRUE))
```

In total `r nrow(featureDefinitions(xdata))` features have been defined in the
present data set, many of which most likely represent signal from different ions
of the same compound. The aim of the grouping functions of this package are now
to define which features most likely come from the same original compound. These
feature grouping functions base on the following assumptions/properties of LC-MS
data:

- Features (ions) of the same compound should have similar retention time.
- The peak shape of extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) of features of the same
  compound should be similar as it should follow the elution pattern of the
  original compound from the chromatogram.
- The abundance of features (ions) of the same compound should have a similar
  pattern across samples, i.e. if a compound is highly concentrated in one
  sample and low in another, all ions from it should follow the same pattern.

The main method to perform the feature grouping is called `groupFeatures` which
takes an `XCMSnExp` object (result object from the `xcms` pre-processing) as
input as well as a parameter object to chose the grouping algorithm and specify
its settings. At present the following approaches are supported:

- `SimilarRtimeParam`: perform a *crude* grouping based on similar retention
  time.
- `EicCorrelationParam`: perform a feature grouping based on correlation of
  EICs.
- `AbundanceCorrelationParam`: perform a feature grouping based on correlation
  of feature abundances (values) across samples.

Calling `groupFeatures` on an `xcms` result object will perform a feature
grouping assigning each feature in the data set to a *feature group*. These
feature groups are stored as an additional columns called `"feature_group"` in
the `featureDefinition` data frame of the result object. Any subsequent
`groupFeature` call will *sub-group* (refine) the identified feature groups
further. It is thus possible to use a single grouping approach, or to combine
multiple of them to generate the desired feature grouping. While the individual
feature grouping algorithms can be called in any order, it is advised to use the
`EicCorrelationParam` as last refinement step, because it is the computationally
most expensive one, especially if applied to a result object without any
pre-defined feature groups or if the feature groups are very large. In the
subsequent sections we will apply the various feature grouping approaches
subsequently.

Note also that we perform here a grouping of all defined features, but it would
also be possible to *just* group a subset of interesting features (e.g. features
found significant by a statistical analysis of the data set). How this can be
achieved is described in the last section of this vignette.

## Grouping of features by similar retention time

The most intuitive and simple way to group features is based on their retention
time. Before we perform this initial grouping we evaluate retention times and
m/z of all features in the present data set. 

```{r feature-rt-mz-plot, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Plot of retention times and m/z for all features in the data set."}
plot(featureDefinitions(xdata)$rtmed, featureDefinitions(xdata)$mzmed,
     xlab = "retention time", ylab = "m/z", main = "features",
     col = "#00000080")
grid()
```

Especially in the earlier retention time range we can see features with about
the same retention time. We below group features within a retention time window
of 10 seconds.

```{r}
xdata <- groupFeatures(xdata, param = SimilarRtimeParam(10))
```

The results from the feature grouping can be accessed with the `featureGroups`
function. Below we determine the size of each of these feature groups (i.e. how
many features are grouped together).

```{r}
table(featureGroups(xdata))
```

Below we plot the results from this feature grouping. Features being grouped
together are connected with a line.

```{r feature-groups-rtime-plot, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Feature groups defined with a rt window of 10 seconds"}
plotFeatureGroups(xdata)
grid()
```

Let's assume we are not totally happy with this feature grouping, also knowing
that there were quite some shifts in retention times between runs. We thus
re-perform the feature grouping based on similar retention time with a larger rt
window. Before we have however to remove the previous results to avoid that
these previous feature groups are simply refined with the following
`groupFeatures` call.

```{r repeat}
## Remove previous feature grouping results to repeat the rtime-based
## feature grouping with different setting
featureDefinitions(xdata)$feature_group <- NULL

## Repeat the grouping
xdata <- groupFeatures(xdata, SimilarRtimeParam(20))
table(featureGroups(xdata))
```

```{r feature-groups-rtime-plot2, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Feature groups defined with a rt window of 20 seconds"}
plotFeatureGroups(xdata)
grid()
```

Note that this grouping approach uses the `groupClosest` function which can
group arbitrary numeric values together based on their similarity. Thus, the
same grouping could also be achieved on a simple single `numeric` vector of
retention times:

```{r group-closest}
groupClosest(featureDefinitions(xdata)$rtmed, 20)
```

Grouping by similar retention time grouped the in total 
`r nrow(featureDefinitions(xdata))` features into 
`r length(unique(featureGroups(xdata)))` feature groups.


## Grouping of features by abundance correlation across samples

Assuming we are OK with the *crude* initial feature grouping from the previous
section, we can next *refine* the feature groups considering also the feature
abundances across samples. We can use the `groupFeatures` method with an
`AbundanceCorrelationParam` object. This approach performs a pairwise
correlation between the feature values (abundances; across samples) between all
features of a predefined feature group (such as defined in the previous
section). Features that have a correlation `>= threshold` are grouped
together. Feature grouping based on this approach works best for features with a
higher variability in their concentration across samples. Parameter `subset`
allows to restrict the analysis to a subset of samples and allows thus to
e.g. exclude QC sample pools from this correlation as these could artificially
increase the correlation. Other parameters are passed directly to the internal
`featureValues` call that extracts the feature values on which the correlation
should be performed.

Before performing the grouping we could also evaluate the correlation of
features based on their (log2 transformed) abundances across samples with a
heatmap.

```{r abundance-correlation-heatmap, fig.cap = "Correlation of features based on feature abundances.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 16}
library(pheatmap)
fvals <- log2(featureValues(xdata, filled = TRUE))

cormat <- cor(t(fvals), use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
ann <- data.frame(fgroup = featureGroups(xdata))
rownames(ann) <- rownames(cormat)

res <- pheatmap(cormat, annotation_row = ann, cluster_rows = TRUE,
                cluster_cols = TRUE)
```

Some large correlations can be observed for several groups of features, but many
of them are not within the same *feature group* as defined in the previous
section (i.e. are not eluting at the same time).

Below we use the `groupFeatures` with the `AbundanceCorrelationParam` to group
features with a correlation higher than 0.7 including both detected and
filled-in signal. Whether filled-in or only detected signal should be used in
the correlation analysis should be evaluated from data set to data set. Note
also that by default the correlation is performed on log2 transformed signals.

```{r abundance-correlation}
xdata <- groupFeatures(xdata, AbundanceCorrelationParam(threshold = 0.7,
                                                        filled = TRUE))
table(featureGroups(xdata))
```

Many of the larger retention time-based feature groups have been splitted into
two or more sub-groups based on the correlation of their feature abundances. We
evaluate this for one specific feature group `"FG.025"` by plotting their
pairwise correlation.

```{r abundance-correlation-fg025, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8, fig.cap = "Pairwise correlation plot for all features initially grouped into the feature group FG.025."}
fts <- grep("FG.025", featureGroups(xdata))
pairs(t(fvals[fts, ]), gap = 0.1, main = "FG.025")
```

Indeed, correlations can be seen only between some of the features in this
retention time feature group, e.g. between *FT034* and *FG036*. Note however
that this abundance correlation suffers from relatively few samples (8 in
total), and a relatively small variance in abundances across these samples.

After feature grouping by abundance correlation, the 
`r nrow(featureDefinitions(xdata))` features have been grouped into 
`r length(unique(featureGroups(xdata)))` feature groups.


## Grouping of features by EIC correlation

The chromatographic peak shape of an ion of a compound should be highly similar
to the elution pattern of this compound. Thus, features from the same compound
are assumed to have similar peak shapes of their EICs **within the same
sample**. Peak shape correlation can be performed with `groupFeatures` and the
`EicCorrelationParam`. It is advisable to perform the peak shape correlation
only on a subset of samples (because peak shape correlation is computationally
intense and because chromatographic peaks of low intensity features are
notoriously noisy). The `EicCorrelationParam` approach has thus the parameter
`n` which allows to select the number of top samples (ordered by total intensity
of feature abundances per feature group) on which the correlation should be
performed. With an value of `n = 3` for each feature group the 3 samples with
the highest signal for all features in that group will be first identified and
then within each of these samples a pairwise correlation will be performed
between peak shapes of all features of the group. The resulting correlation
coefficients from these 3 samples will then be reduced to a single correlation
coefficient by taking the 75% quantile across the 3 samples. This value is then
subsequently compared with the threshold correlation coefficient (parameter
`threshold`) and only features are grouped together that have a correlation
coefficient larger than this value.

Below we group the features based on their EIC correlation in the two samples
with the highest total signal for the respective feature groups. We require the
correlation of the peak shape to be higher than 0.7. With `clean = TRUE` we also
ensure that only the signal within the actually detected chromatographic peaks
is used.

```{r correlate-eic}
xdata <- groupFeatures(xdata, EicCorrelationParam(threshold = 0.7, n = 2,
                                                  clean = TRUE))
```

This is the most computationally intense approach since it involves also loading
the raw MS data to extract the ion chromatograms for each feature. The results
of the grouping are shown below.

```{r correlate-eic-result}
table(featureGroups(xdata))
```

In most cases, pre-defined feature groups (by the abundance correlation) were
not further subdivided. Below we evaluate some of the feature groups starting
with *FG.007.02* which was split into two different feature groups based on EIC
correlation. We first extract the EICs for all features from this initial
feature group. With `n = 1` we specify to extract the EIC only from the
sample with the highest intensity.

```{r}
fts <- grep("FG.007.02", featureGroups(xdata))
eics <- featureChromatograms(xdata, features = fts,
                             filled = TRUE, n = 1)
```

Next we plot the EICs using a different color for each of the subgroups.

```{r example-1-eic, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "EICs of features from feature group FG.007.02, colors label different feature sub-groups. Shown are the actual intensities (left) and intensities normalized to 1 (right)."}
cols <- c("#ff000080", "#00ff0080")
names(cols) <- unique(featureGroups(xdata)[fts])

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plotOverlay(eics, col = cols[featureGroups(xdata)[fts]], lwd = 2)
plotOverlay(normalize(eics), col = cols[featureGroups(xdata)[fts]], lwd = 2)

```

One feature initially grouped together with all other features based on the
abundance correlation was separated from them based on the EIC correlation. In
addition, two features seem to have only a single peak, while the others have a
double peak. Here it is not clear if it would be better to include the feature
labeled in green in the main feature group, or if the feature group should be
further splitted based on the presence of the additional peak. Since these EICs
were all extracted from the same sample, the shift observed for the green
colored feature the can not be the result from a mis-alignment hence suggesting
that this feature might be indeed be from a different compound.

We evaluate next the sub-grouping in another feature group.

```{r}
fts <- grep("FG.030.01", featureGroups(xdata))
eics <- featureChromatograms(xdata, features = fts,
                             filled = TRUE, n = 1)
```

Next we plot the EICs using a different color for each of the subgroups.

```{r example-2-eic, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "EICs of features from feature group FG.030.01, colors label different feature sub-groups. Shown are the actual intensities (left) and intensities normalized to 1 (right)."}
cols <- c("#ff000080", "#00ff0080")
names(cols) <- unique(featureGroups(xdata)[fts])

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plotOverlay(eics, col = cols[featureGroups(xdata)[fts]], lwd = 2)
plotOverlay(normalize(eics), col = cols[featureGroups(xdata)[fts]], lwd = 2)

```

Based on the EIC correlation, the initial feature group *FG.030.01* was grouped
into two separate sub-groups, each consisting of two features, one with a single
peak and one with a double peak.

The grouping based on EIC correlation on the pre-defined feature groups from the
previous sections grouped the `r nrow(featureDefinitions(xdata))` features into
`r length(unique(featureGroups(xdata)))` feature groups.


## Grouping of subsets of features

In the previous sections we were always considering all features from the data
set, but sometimes it could be desirable to just group a pre-defined set of
features, for example features found to be of particular interest in a certain
experiment (e.g. significant features). This can be easily achieved by assigning
the features of interest to a initial feature group, using `NA` as group ID
for all other features.

To illustrate this we *reset* all feature groups by setting them to `NA` and
assign our features of interest (in this example just 30 randomly selected
features) to an initial feature group `"FG"`.

```{r reset-feature-groups}
featureDefinitions(xdata)$feature_group <- NA_character_

set.seed(123)
fts_idx <- sample(1:nrow(featureDefinitions(xdata)), 30)
featureDefinitions(xdata)$feature_group[fts_idx] <- "FG"
```

Any call to `groupFeatures` would now simply sub-group this set of 30
features. Any feature which has an `NA` in the `"feature_group"` column will be
ignored.

```{r rtime-grouping}
xdata <- groupFeatures(xdata, SimilarRtimeParam(diffRt = 20))
xdata <- groupFeatures(xdata, AbundanceCorrelationParam(threshold = 0.7))
table(featureGroups(xdata))
```
